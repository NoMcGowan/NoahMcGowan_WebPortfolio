                My experience in web development has broadened my understanding of how technology can positively impact people's lives. Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the significance of user-centered design, ensuring that technology is accessible and beneficial for all users, especially those less familiar with it.

                I plan to continue expanding my skills through professional development opportunities, workshops, and certifications. I believe that staying updated with the latest technologies and best practices is crucial in an ever-evolving field like cybersecurity.
