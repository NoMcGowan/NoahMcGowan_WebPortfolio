            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Noah McGowan, and I am currently a senior at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, specializing in Computer Information Systems. 
                I am passionate about cybersecurity and data analysis, with the goal of ensuring safer digital experiences for all users, particularly those who may be less familiar with technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into the tech world started with a fascination for how technology could solve real-world problems. This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems, 
                where I've gained skills in web development, network security, and data management. Along the way, I’ve developed a particular interest in cybersecurity, 
                recognizing the growing importance of protecting personal information in an increasingly connected world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience with several programming languages including JavaScript, Python, and C++, and I work with tools such as Git, GitHub, and Linux. 
                I am constantly looking to improve my skills, particularly in the areas of secure coding and network defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my studies, I enjoy staying active through soccer, both indoors and outdoors, and I’m also an avid music enjoyer. In my free time, 
                I love exploring how emerging technologies can contribute to a safer, more transparent digital landscape for everyone. 
            </p>

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, I aim to pursue a career in cybersecurity, with a strong passion for making the growing technological landscape safer for users who may not be as tech-savvy. 
                As the digital world expands, protecting everyday users from cyber threats, data breaches, and online fraud has become more critical than ever. 
                I hope to specialize in building secure systems, educating users on safe online practices, and contributing to a safer, more accessible technological environment for everyone.
